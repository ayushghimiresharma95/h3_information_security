### GPG 
GPG (GNU Privacy Guard) is an open-source encryption tool that allows you to encrypt and sign your data and communications. It's part of the OpenPGP standard, which defines encryption for securing emails, files, and other data, providing both confidentiality (through encryption) and authenticity (through digital signatures).

--> We need two users for communications 

First user -> ayush 
Second user -> Bob

#### Step 1 . 


$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install gpg micro psmisc

#### Step 2.  Creating a keypair

gpg --gen-key

tis will ask our email and name and then write "O"

#### Step 3. Now we need to check the keypair

gpg --fingerprint

This consists of fingerprint and secret key.

#### Step 4. Now , we need to export the key 

$ cd
$ gpg --export --armor --output ayush.pub
Parameters to export are

--export Export my public key
--armor Only use ASCII characters, so that the output can be viewed and copy -asted.
--output tero.pub Save the output into the file "ayush.pub"


Step 5. Now we have to do the same thing for the Bob


gpg --homedir . --gen-key


Step 6. Bob will verfies and sign the key 

gpg --homedir . --import ayush.pub
gpg --homedir . --sign-key "B624 CDED 2430 252D 298D  7EC4 A8D8 1658 00B3 84A3"


Step 7. Ayush also needs to verfies and sign the key

$ gpg --import bob.pub
$ gpg --sign-key "B20F D80B 705C 791D C878  0030 7BAA 4F13 2645 134F"

Now the trust has been establised, we will use the micro to write a message then we will encrypt that message using gpg and send over the ayush , so that he can decrypt the message and see what inside the message.
